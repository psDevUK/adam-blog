I do get tasked with what I might consider on first request very bizarre requests. Like at work a senior manager decided I was the man to build a fleet management system from scratch.

Not knowing about vehicles and what was involved I first off needed to gather information from the people who were currently inputting the information into a spreadsheet.

Armed with the new information on vehicles and the type of information that needed to be recorded, I was able to build a database to store all the required information I needed to gather.

As mentioned this was being managed on a spreadsheet, but was thinking a dashboard is a much better way, so did just that. Put a dashboard in place to allow multiple uses access at the same time, something a spreadsheet canâ€™t, created a back-end database to store all the information, then built some forms on the dashboard with validation rules, and used the data provided from the end user to display statistical information on that particular vehicle. Here is a GIF of the dashboard in action:-

There was a lot of learning and reading of the universal dashboard document which is located right here:- [ud docs][ud-docs] thankfully the developer of universal dashboard has done a great job documenting all the controls and how to use the module. There is even a site here:- [poshud][poshud] which shows off a site running universal dashboard on the internet. This also shows you the user interface controls, and how to use them with some code examples.

There was a lot more work involved in getting this project completed, having got such positive feedback from this dashboard, I decided to share it right here on my [github][my-gh]
