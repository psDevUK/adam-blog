This project actually started about another year before the listed date. I was asked to help put together a proper complaint system for the company. So at the time I was using Powershell Studio 2017 and literally this took me ages to design and code, and this was the best looking thing I could produce:-

![Powershell Studio]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/old.jpg)

As always I was asked to modify 'things' within the complaint system, which then meant a whole world of pain for me, as the code is so bloated when using powershell studio as the components you drag an drop onto the page adds so much more code. So it became really difficult for me to maintain, and no matter how hard I tried the forms always looked like they were designed for windows 95. I mean I had been using powershell studio for a good couple of years and that is the best my design ability was within this program.

I wanted to apply a new lok and feel to the complaint system, so I did just that by rebuilding the system in UD:-

I think this is a no-brainer to say that the UD version looks so, so much better. Not only is it better for producing beautiful applications, it is hundreds of times better at producing fancy charts and graphs. Like there is no way on earth I would have been able to produce this in Powershell Studio:-

![Chart]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/graph.jpg)

There is a legend at the top of this explaining what all the different colours on the chart relate to, and the chart has hover-over ability which then shows you the information for what you are hovering over.

I was even able to include a custom component for this dashboard, to receive some feedback from the end-users using my application:-

![New Complaint]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/complaintnew.jpg)

Thought this would be a good thing to implement to also help me develop the application to be even better by taking suggestions from the feedback being received.

It's just great to be able to provide applications to help make the company you work for more efficient in dealing with certain things.

I hope these blogs show how versatile Universal Dashboard is, as most of my projects are not really I.T related.
