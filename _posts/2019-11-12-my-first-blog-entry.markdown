This blog site is being hosted on my github page and is using Jekyll under the hood to generate this lovely looking site. I am not a blogger so using this opportunity to bring out the blogger in me, and blog about my journey using Powershell Universal Dashboard

So I have been using Powershell Universal Dashboard for just over a year. Previously to using Universal Dashboard, I was using Powershell Studio 2017. To develop and deploy solutions to problems, however since converting to becoming a dashboarder I now only use Powershell Universal Dashboards to develop my applications. I have even converted previous windows form applications I did to now be presented in a web-page in a dashboard styled interface.

Why have I chosen to only use Universal Dashboard? What powers or advantages does this give me? Well if you stick with me on this blog journey you will have the answers to these questions.

As mentioned this site was designed using Jekyll, more information is in the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] If you have questions for me, you can ask them on [twitter][twitter].

Thanks for reading my first blog.
